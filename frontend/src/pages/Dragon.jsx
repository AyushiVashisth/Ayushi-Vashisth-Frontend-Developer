            SpaceX's CEO, Elon Musk, named the spacecraft after the 1963 song
            "Puff, the Magic Dragon" by Peter, Paul and Mary, reportedly as a
            response to critics who considered his spaceflight projects
            impossible.[2] Early on, it had actually been named Magic Dragon,
            and t-shirts had been printed with this name.[3] As late as
            September 2012, SpaceX board member Steve Jurvetson was still
            referring to it as "The Magic Dragon, Puffed to the sea."[4] That
            was his caption to a photo of the capsule several months after it
            had completed its COTS 2 demo flight where the spacecraft had
            accomplished its first docking with the ISS. This song, ostensibly
            composed for children, had long been associated with perceived
            references to smoking marijuana. In 2008, Elon Musk confirmed that
            the association between the song and marijuana was the reason behind
            the name Dragon, saying that "so many people thought I [must be]
            smoking weed to do this venture."[5]

            American private space transportation company SpaceX has developed
            and produced several spacecraft named Dragon. The first family
            member, now referred to as Dragon 1, flew 23 cargo missions to the
            ISS between 2010 and 2020 before retiring. With this first version
            not designed for carrying astronauts, it was funded by NASA with
            $396 million awarded through the Commercial Orbital Transportation
            Services (COTS) program,[1] with SpaceX being announced as a winner
            of the first round of funding on August 18, 2006.

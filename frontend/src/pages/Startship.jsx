            The third version of the Falcon 9 was developed in 2014–2015 and
            made its maiden flight in December 2015. The Falcon 9 Full Thrust is
            a modified reusable variant of the Falcon 9 family with capabilities
            that exceed the Falcon 9 v1.1, including the ability to "land the
            first stage for geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions on the
            drone ship"[16][17] The rocket was designed using systems and
            software technology that had been developed as part of the SpaceX
            reusable launch system development program, a private initiative by
            SpaceX to facilitate rapid reusability of both the first–and in the
            long term, second—stages of SpaceX launch vehicles.[18] Various
            technologies were tested on the Grasshopper technology demonstrator,
            as well as several flights of the Falcon 9 v1.1 on which
            post-mission booster controlled-descent tests were being
            conducted.[19]

            Falcon 9 Full Thrust (also known as Falcon 9 v1.2, with variants
            Block 1 to Block 5) is a partially reusable medium-lift launch
            vehicle, designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It was first designed
            in 2014–2015, with its first launch operations in December 2015. As
            of 2 September 2023, Falcon 9 Full Thrust had performed 232 launches
            without any failures. Based on the Lewis point estimate of
            reliability,[definition needed] this rocket is the most reliable
            orbital launch vehicle currently in operation.[10] On April 8, 2016,
            the Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9 family was the first launch
            vehicle on an orbital trajectory to successfully vertically land a
            first stage. The landing followed a technology development program
            conducted from 2013 to 2015. Some of the required technology
            advances, such as landing legs, were pioneered on the Falcon 9 v1.1
            version, but that version never landed intact. Starting in 2017,
            previously flown first-stage boosters were reused to launch new
            payloads into orbit.[11][12] This quickly became routine, in 2018
            and in 2019 more than half of all Falcon 9 flights reused a booster.
            In 2020 the fraction of reused boosters increased to 81%.
